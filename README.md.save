# Lenovo Battery Conservation Toggle Script

This script allows you to toggle battery conservation mode on Lenovo laptops running Linux. This helps extend the lifespan of your battery by limiting the charge to a specified threshold.

## Features
- Enable or disable battery conservation mode.
- Toggle the battery charge threshold between 60% (for conservation) and 75% (default).
- Compatible with Lenovo laptops using the `ideapad_acpi` driver.

## Requirements
- Linux (tested on Fedora, should work on other distributions with `tlp` and `ideapad_acpi`).
- `tlp` must be installed for managing battery charge thresholds.
- The laptop should be using the `ideapad_acpi` driver (common on Lenovo laptops).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lenovo-battery-conservation-toggle.git
   cd lenov
